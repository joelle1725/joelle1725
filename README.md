## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

Currently studying Informatics with a minor in Business at the University of Washington, I’m passionate about building things that genuinely help people. From working on AI-powered products to leading student communities and creating content, I enjoy turning ideas into meaningful, real-world experiences.

My experience spans AI-powered product work, consulting projects, and community leadership, where I translate user needs into structured solutions and actionable strategy. I enjoy working at the intersection of **technology, business, and people**—where problem-solving meets storytelling and strategy meets empathy.

I’m motivated by creating products that are both meaningful and scalable.
